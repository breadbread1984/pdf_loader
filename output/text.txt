Practice Notes for Mandatory Building and Window Inspection Schemes

The Practice Notes for Mandatory Building and Window Inspection Schemes (PNBIs) serve as a platform for the dissemination of information and good practices to the registered practitioners for the implementation of the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS) and Mandatory Window Inspection Scheme (MWIS). The Building Authority will issue the PNBIs from time to time for the reference of registered inspectors (RIs), qualified persons (QPs) and registered contractors (RCs) as well as other stakeholders as necessary.

Other Relevant References

2. The Buildings Department has published a Code of Practice on MBIS and MWIS (the ‘CoP’) to provide detailed guidelines on building and window inspection as well as the required repair works under the two schemes. The CoP also specifies the technical standards and procedural requirements for RIs, QPs and RCs for the carrying out of inspection of buildings and windows and supervision of the repair works.

3. Apart from the PNBIs, the RIs, QPs and RCs should also make reference to the relevant Practice Notes for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAPs) and Practice Notes for Registered Contractors (PNRCs) issued by the Building Authority. The more relevant PNAPs and PNRCs are listed in Appendix I for easy reference. Please note that the list is not exhaustive and in order to meet specific requirements of individual cases, one may need to make reference to other PNAPs and PNRCs for guidance.

4. It is envisaged that the majority of repair works carried out under the MBIS and MWIS are minor works under the Buildings Ordinance. It is therefore important that the practitioners involved in the MBIS and MWIS should have a good knowledge of the Minor Works Control System. In this connection, reference may be made to the Technical Guidelines on Minor Works Control System published by the Buildings Department.
