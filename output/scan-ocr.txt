Precautionary Measures for Public and Building Safety during Typhoon Season

Precautionary Measures for Public and Building Safety during Typhoon Season

1.

At the approach of typhoon season, I am writing to solicit your co-operation in

paying special attention to the threat that may be posed by typhoons to the buildings/estates under your management.

2.

From past experience, many public and building safety incidents caused by

typhoons could have been avoided if proper precautionary measures have been taken. Some examples are:

(a)

Inspect roof, podium, flat roof and basement (including car park) to ensure

surface water drains and rainwater manholes are in good working order without blockage;

(b)

Inspect all projections and installations at the building exteriors (e.g. scaffolding, signboard, advertisement, decoration, photovoltaic panel and its supporting structure or supporting structure for other building services installation) as well as remind the owner/occupant to pay attention and make necessary arrangement with them to ensure such are in secure and safe conditions;

(c)

Provide suitable pumping equipment at areas of flooding risk such as

electrical and mechanical plant rooms and basement car park;

Inspect slopes and retaining walls within the development to ascertain any (d) anomalies (e.g. cracks, drains blocked, mud oozing, fallen rocks);

(e)

Advise the owner/occupant to provide proper protection materials or

devices for windows, glass doors and glass panels in exposed positions, and to ensure all openable windows (including curtain walls) are securely closed and locked;

(f)

Ensure gondola (if any) parked at safe location and is properly secured; and

(g)

Remove/relocate the potential target/object that may be hit by a fallen

tree/branch, or restrict access/cordon off the area within the possible tree fall zone.
